 This little project demonstrates programmatic use of Cocoa bindings.
 
 We do the following:
 - Create bindings with the Interface Builder (button's title)
 - Create bindigns programmatically for IB controls (theSlider, theLabel)
 - Create bindings programmatically for a custom view (monsterView)
 
 As you'll see bindings just work. There's some magic going on behind the scenes:

 This is especially useful for custom views - as long as you name your accessors
 in a KVO compilant way bindings will work automagically.
